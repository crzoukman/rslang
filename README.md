# RS Lang

Final group project in RS School (EPAM) for 3 people. I was a team-leader / frontend-dev / designer. It helps people in learning English. The ideas were taken from [lingualeo.com](https://lingualeo.com/).

## What does it do?

You can learn new words using flashcards. Or you can learn new words playing one of the two games Sprint/Audiochallenge. Also statistic page is available to track your successes. Just check it out!
